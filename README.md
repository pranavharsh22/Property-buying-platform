In this Project I have made a serach bar which will help to search the properties by location name.
Also there are filters which is used to filter the properties based on Price, Location, Number of beds which I have made by using javascript.
Also when we click on the buy now button the product will be added to the cart aand at the bottom we can see the subtotal also I have used React-Toastify to indicate the user about each and every function the user is doing.
Also there is a checkout button so when we click it will navigate us to the checkout page where we have to give our details and on that form I have applied many validation based on card number,cvv etc.
On clicking the book now button that property will be added to the booked properties section. We can go to the booked section by clicking on the Booked section button present on the navigation bar.
I am fetching the properties from the backend where there is a dummy data of properties.
In this project I have used Redux for add to cart remove from cart and clear cart functionalities etc.
Also the website is responsive with the help of mediaquery.
